Create an information app

This is an information app to practise node.js 
for backend server development. I would practise: installation of 3rd party software such as ejs, express, lodash, mongoose and morgan using npm.  Additionally, I would deploy the mongo database.  Moreover, I would utilize a modular design such as models, views and controllers (MVC) and routes. Furthermore, I would create an init file to track all dependencies of the project. Finally, I would create a public folder to treat with static pages such as images and css
